Prompt:
You are responsible for the command line interface used by the user to run the program.
Create a file, userinterface.txt, in the docs folder to document the user interface.
(the command prompt options)

Purpose:
Take user input provided by program control calling parseArgs() method, validate that
our FileID is in the correct format and useable and return a UiRequest Object that
contains #fileID and #cipherKey so that they are easily callable for other team members.
Also provides a callable printFiles() function that can be called by program control
in the event that no arguments are provided. Provides print error functions for program
control.

Class Structure:
UserInterface.java
- Receives command-line arguments (passed from Team Member C)
- Determines which request path to run (with ID vs. no ID)
- Validates Id and cipherKey argument and returns it under new object UiRequest
- Returns a validated request (fileId + optional keyArg) back to Team Member C

Extra class:
UiRequest (IMPORTANT FOR EACH MEMBER)
- contains a fileID variable
- contains a cipherKey variable
- has getters for each variable
- validates the existence of each variable

Methods:

UiRequest parseArgs(String[] args)
- Inspects args.length
- Validates and sends the argument count
- Validates the format of our fileID
- Sets our cipher key if necessary
- returns a UiRequest object with our fileID variables and cipher key variables

printFileList(List<String> files)
- prints each file with a number (fileID)

printFileContents(String contents)
- prints the contents of the file requested

printError(String message)
- prints a error message for the user
- does not exit the program, just controls what user sees

Error Handling:
- Non-numeric file IDs
- Blank input / whitespace-only input
- ID not in list
On any error: send to member b to exit the program

Tests: 
1. No args, multiple files: interactiveFileSelection runs, list prints, valid selection returns
2. Invalid id input (letters / blank / whitespace) → exits with error
3. Out-of-range id (not in list) → exits with error
4. Direct id arg valid (e.g., 01) → parseDirectFileRequest returns correct UiRequest
5. Direct id arg invalid (e.g., -1, abc) → exits with error
6. Too many args (if enforced) → exits with error
