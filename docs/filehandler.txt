Prompt:
You are responsible for the part of the
problem that reads data files.
The program should expect files in a folder named data (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
When a request for a file is received,
this part of the program will return the file contents.
This part of the program should handle all the direct access to files.
Document the plan your team makes for the design of your software in a text file named filehandler.txt.
